Abstract

   This memo outlines high-level requirements for the integration of
   flexible Mandatory Access Control (MAC) functionality into the
   Network File System (NFS) version 4.2 (NFSv4.2).  It describes the
   level of protections that should be provided over protocol components
   and the basic structure of the proposed system.  The intent here is
   not to present the protocol <strike><font color='red'>changes,</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>changes</font></strong> but to describe the environment
   in which they reside.

1.  Introduction

   Mandatory Access Control (MAC) ([RFC4949]) systems have been
   mainstreamed in modern operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, and
   Solaris.  MAC systems bind security attributes to subjects
   (processes) and objects within a system.  These attributes are used
   with other information in the system to make access control
   decisions.

   Access control models such as Unix permissions or Access Control
   Lists <strong><font color='green'>(ACLs)</font></strong> are commonly referred to as Discretionary Access Control
   (DAC) models.  These systems base their access decisions on user
   identity and resource ownership.  In <strike><font color='red'>contrast</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>contrast,</font></strong> MAC models base their
   access control decisions on the label on the subject (usually a
   process) and the object it wishes to access.  These labels may
   contain user identity information but usually contain additional
   information.  In DAC <strike><font color='red'>systems</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>systems,</font></strong> users are free to specify the access
   rules for resources that they own.  MAC models base their security
   decisions on a <strike><font color='red'>system
   wide</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>system-wide</font></strong> policy established by an administrator or
   organization <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> the users do not have the ability to override.  DAC
   systems <strike><font color='red'>offers</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>offer</font></strong> some protection against unauthorized users running
   malicious software.  However, even an authorized user can execute
   malicious or flawed software with those programs running with the
   full permissions of the user executing it.  <strike><font color='red'>Inversely</font></strike>  <strong><font color='green'>Inversely,</font></strong> MAC models can
   confine malicious or flawed software and usually act at a finer
   granularity than their DAC counterparts.

   Besides describing the requirements, this document records the
   functional requirements for the client imposed by the <strike><font color='red'>pre-existing</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>preexisting</font></strong>
   security models on the client.  This document may help those outside
   the NFS community understand those issues.

2.  Definitions

   Foreign Label:  <strike><font color='red'>is when a MAC implementation encounters</font></strike>  a label in a format other than <strike><font color='red'>it</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>the format that a MAC
      implementation</font></strong> uses for encoding.

   Label Format Specifier (LFS):  <strike><font color='red'>is</font></strike>  an identifier used by the client to
      establish the syntactic format of the security label and the
      semantic meaning of its components.

   Label Format Registry:  <strike><font color='red'>is</font></strike>  the IANA registry (see <strike><font color='red'>[lfsreg])</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>[LFSReg])</font></strong> containing
      all registered <strike><font color='red'>LFS</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>LFSs,</font></strong> along with references to the documents that
      describe the syntactic format and semantics of the security label.

   MAC-Aware:  <strike><font color='red'>is</font></strike>  a server <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> can transmit and store object labels.

   MAC-Functional:  <strike><font color='red'>is</font></strike>  a client or server <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> is Labeled NFS enabled.
      Such a system can interpret labels and apply policies based on the
      security system.

   Multi-Level Security (MLS):  <strike><font color='red'>is</font></strike>  a traditional model where objects are
      given a sensitivity level (Unclassified, Secret, Top Secret, <strike><font color='red'>etc)</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>etc.)</font></strong>
      and a category set [RH_MLS].

   Object:  <strike><font color='red'>is</font></strike>  a passive resource within the system that we wish to <strike><font color='red'>be
      protected.</font></strike>
      <strong><font color='green'>protect.</font></strong>  Objects can be entities such as files, directories,
      pipes, sockets, and many other system resources relevant to the
      protection of the system state.

   Policy Identifier (PI):  <strike><font color='red'>is</font></strike>  an optional part of the definition of a
      Label Format <strike><font color='red'>Specifier which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>Specifier.  The PI</font></strong> allows <strike><font color='red'>for</font></strike> clients and <strike><font color='red'>server</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>servers</font></strong> to
      identify specific security policies.

   Subject:  <strike><font color='red'>is</font></strike>  an active entity, usually a process, <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> is requesting
      access to an object.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Requirements

   The following initial requirements have been gathered from <strike><font color='red'>users,</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>users and</font></strong>
   developers, and from previous development efforts in this area such
   as <strike><font color='red'>DTOS</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>the Distributed Trusted Operating System</font></strong> [DTOS] and <strong><font color='green'>the</font></strong> NSA's
   experimental NFSv3 enhancements <strike><font color='red'>[SENFSV3].</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>[SENFSv3].</font></strong>

3.1.  General

   A mechanism is required to provide security attribute information to
   NFSv4 clients and servers.  This mechanism has the following
   requirements:

   (1)  Clients MUST be able to convey to the server the client's
      <strike><font color='red'>priveleges,</font></strike>
        <strong><font color='green'>privileges,</font></strong> i.e., the subject, for making the access request.
        The server may provide a mechanism to enforce MAC policy based
        on the requesting client's <strike><font color='red'>priveleges.</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>privileges.</font></strong>

   (2)  Servers MUST be able to store and retrieve the security
        attribute of exported files as requested by the client.

   (3)  Servers MUST provide a mechanism for notifying clients of
        attribute changes of files on the server.

   (4)  Clients and Servers MUST be able to negotiate Label Formats and
        provide a mechanism to translate between them as needed.

3.2.  Security Services

   Labeled NFS or the underlying system on which the Labeled NFS
   operates MUST provide the following security services for all NFSv4.2
   <strike><font color='red'>messaging</font></strike>
   <strong><font color='green'>messaging:</font></strong>

   o  Authentication

   o  Integrity

   o  Privacy

   Mechanisms and algorithms used in the provision of security services
   MUST be <strike><font color='red'>configurable,</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>configurable</font></strong> so that appropriate levels of protection may be
   flexibly specified per mandatory security policy.

   Strong mutual authentication is required between the server and the
   client for Full Mode operation <strike><font color='red'>Section 4.1.</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>(Section 4.1).</font></strong>

   MAC security labels and any related security state MUST always be
   protected by these security services when transferred over the
   <strike><font color='red'>network;</font></strike>
   <strong><font color='green'>network,</font></strong> as MUST the binding of labels and state to associated
   objects and subjects.

   Labeled NFS SHOULD support authentication on a context granularity so
   that different contexts running on a client can use different
   cryptographic keys and facilities.

3.3.  Label Encoding, Label Format Specifiers, and Label Checking
      Authorities

   Encoding of MAC labels and attributes passed over the network MUST be
   specified in a complete and unambiguous manner while maintaining the
   flexibility of MAC implementations.  To accomplish <strike><font color='red'>this</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>this,</font></strong> the labels
   MUST consist of a format-specific component bound with a Label Format
   Specifier (LFS).  The LFS component provides a mechanism for
   identifying the structure and semantics of the opaque component.
   Meanwhile, the opaque component is the security label <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> will be
   interpreted by the MAC models.

   MAC models base access decisions on security <strike><font color='red'>attributes priveleges</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>attribute privileges</font></strong>
   bound to subjects and objects, respectively.  With a given MAC model,
   all systems have semantically coherent labeling <strike><font color='red'>-</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>--</font></strong> a security label
   MUST always mean exactly the same thing on every system.  While this
   may not be necessary for simple MAC <strike><font color='red'>models</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>models,</font></strong> it is recommended that
   most label formats assigned an LFS incorporate semantically coherent
   labeling into their label format.

   Labeled NFS SHOULD define an initial negotiation scheme with the
   primary aims of simplicity and completeness.  This is to facilitate
   practical deployment of systems without being weighed down by complex
   and <strike><font color='red'>over-generalized</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>overgeneralized</font></strong> global schemes.  Future extensibility SHOULD also
   be taken into consideration.

   Labeled NFS MUST provide a means for servers and clients to identify
   their <strike><font color='red'>LFS</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>LFSs</font></strong> for the purposes of authorization, security service
   selection, and security label interpretation.

   Labeled NFS MUST provide a means for servers and clients to identify
   their mode of operation (see Section 4).

   A negotiation scheme SHOULD be provided, allowing systems from
   different label formats to agree on how they will interpret or
   translate each <strike><font color='red'>others</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>other's</font></strong> foreign labels.  Multiple concurrent
   agreements may be current between a server and a client.

   All security labels and related security state transferred across the
   network MUST be tagged with a valid LFS.

   If the LFS supported on a system changes, the system SHOULD
   renegotiate agreements to reflect these changes.

   If a system receives any security label or security state tagged with
   an LFS it does not recognize or cannot interpret, it MUST reject that
   label or state.

   NFSv4.2 includes features <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> may cause a client to cross an LFS
   boundary when accessing what appears to be a single file system.  If
   LFS negotiation is supported by the client and the server, the server
   SHOULD negotiate a new, concurrent agreement with the client, acting
   on behalf of the externally located source of the files.

3.4.  Labeling

   Implementations MUST validate security labels supplied over the
   network to ensure that they are within a set of labels permitted from
   a specific <strike><font color='red'>peer, and</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>peer and,</font></strong> if not, reject them.  Note that a system may
   permit a different set of labels to be accepted from each peer.

3.4.1.  Client Labeling

   At the client, labeling semantics for NFS mounted file systems MUST
   remain consistent with those for locally mounted file systems.  In
   particular, user-level labeling operations local to the client MUST
   be enacted locally via existing APIs, to ensure compatibility and
   consistency for applications and libraries.

   Note that this does not imply any specific mechanism for conveying
   labels over the network.

   When an object is newly created by the client, it will calculate the
   label for the object based on its policy.  Once that is <strike><font color='red'>done</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>done,</font></strong> it will
   send the request to the <strike><font color='red'>server</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>server,</font></strong> which has the ability to deny the
   creation of the object with that label based on the server's policy.
   In creating the <strike><font color='red'>file</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>file,</font></strong> the server MUST ensure that the label is bound
   to the object before the object becomes visible to the rest of the
   system.  This ensures that any access control or further labeling
   decisions are correct for the object.

3.4.2.  Server Labeling

   The server MUST provide the capability for clients to retrieve
   security labels on all exported file system objects where possible.
   This includes cases where only in-core and/or read-only security
   labels are available at the server for any of its exported file
   systems.

   The server MUST honor the ability for a client to specify the label
   of an object on creation.  If the server is MAC <strike><font color='red'>enabled</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>enabled,</font></strong> it may
   choose to reject the label specified by the <strike><font color='red'>client</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>client,</font></strong> due to
   restrictions in the server policy.  The server SHOULD NOT attempt to
   find a suitable label for an object in <strong><font color='green'>the</font></strong> event of different
   labeling rules on its end.  The server is allowed to translate the
   label but MUST NOT change the semantic meaning of the label.

3.5.  Policy Enforcement

   The MAC-Functional client determines if a process request is sent to
   the remote server.  Upon a successful response from the server, it
   must use its own policies on the object's security labels to
   determine if the process can be given access.  The client SHOULD NOT
   need to be cognizant if the server is either a Limited Server or
   fully MAC-Functional.

3.5.1.  Client Enforcement

   The client MUST apply its own policy to remotely located objects,
   using security labels for the objects obtained from the server.  It
   MUST be possible to configure the maximum length of time a client may
   cache state regarding remote labels before <strike><font color='red'>re-validating</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>revalidating</font></strong> that state
   with the server.

   If the server's policy changes, the client MUST flush all object
   state back to the server.  The server MUST ensure that any flushed
   state received is consistent with current policy before committing it
   to stable storage.

   Any local security state associated with cached or delegated objects
   MUST also be flushed back to the server when any other state of the
   objects is required to be flushed back.

   The implication here is that if the client holds a delegation on an
   object, then it enforces policy to local changes based on the object
   label it got from the server.  When it tries to commit those changes
   to the server, it SHOULD be prepared for the server to reject those
   changes based on the policies of the server.

3.5.2.  Server Enforcement

   A MAC-Functional server MUST enforce its security policy over all
   exported objects, for operations <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> originate both locally and
   remotely.

   Requests from authenticated clients MUST be processed using security
   labels and credentials supplied by the client as if they originated
   locally.

   As with labeling, the system MUST also take into account any other
   volatile client security state, such as a change in process security
   context via dynamic transition.  Access decisions SHOULD also be made
   based upon the current client security label accessing the object,
   rather than the security label <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> opened it, if different.

   The server SHOULD recall delegation of an object if the object's
   security label changes.

3.6.  Namespace Access

   The server SHOULD provide a means to authorize selective access to
   the exported file system namespace based upon client credentials and
   according to security policy.

   This is a common requirement of MLS-enabled systems, which often need
   to present selective views of namespaces based upon the clearances of
   the subjects.

3.7.  Upgrading Existing Server

   Note that under the MAC model, all objects MUST have labels.
   Therefore, if an existing server is upgraded to include Labeled NFS
   support, then it is the responsibility of the security system to
   define the behavior for existing objects.

4.  Modes of Operation

   In a Labeled NFS client and server interaction, we can describe three
   modes of operation:

   1.  Full

   2.  Limited Server

   3.  Guest

   These modes arise from the level of MAC functionality in the clients
   and servers.  The clients can be non-MAC-Functional and MAC-
   Functional.  The servers can be non-MAC-Functional, MAC-Aware, and
   MAC-Functional.

   A MAC-Functional client MUST be able to determine the level of MAC
   functionality in the server.  Likewise, a MAC-Functional server MUST
   be able to determine whether or not a client is MAC-Functional.  As
   discussed in Section 3.3, the protocol MUST provide for the client
   and server to make those determinations.

4.1.  Full Mode

   The server and the client have mutually recognized MAC functionality
   enabled, and full Labeled NFS functionality is extended over the
   network between both client and server.

   An example of an operation in full mode is as follows.  On the
   initial lookup, the client requests access to an object on the
   server.  It sends its process security context over to the server.
   The server checks all relevant policies to determine if that process
   context from that client is allowed to access the resource.  Once
   this has <strike><font color='red'>succeeded</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>succeeded,</font></strong> the <strike><font color='red'>object</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>object,</font></strong> with its associated security
   <strike><font color='red'>information</font></strike>
   <strong><font color='green'>information,</font></strong> is released to the client.  Once the client receives the
   <strike><font color='red'>object</font></strike>
   <strong><font color='green'>object,</font></strong> it determines if its policies allow the process running on
   the client access to the object.

   On subsequent operations where the client already has a handle for
   the file, the order of enforcement is reversed.  Since the client
   already has the security <strike><font color='red'>context</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>context,</font></strong> it may make an access decision
   against its policy first.  This enables the client to avoid sending
   requests to the server that it knows will <strike><font color='red'>fail</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>fail,</font></strong> regardless of the
   server's policy.  If the client passes its policy <strike><font color='red'>checks</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>checks,</font></strong> then it
   sends the request to the <strike><font color='red'>server</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>server,</font></strong> where the client's process context
   is used to determine if the server will release that resource to the
   client.  If both checks pass, the client is given the resource and
   everything succeeds.

   In the event that the client does not trust the server, it may opt to
   use an alternate labeling <strike><font color='red'>mechanism</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>mechanism,</font></strong> regardless of the server's
   ability to return security information.

4.2.  Limited Server Mode

   The server is <strike><font color='red'>MAC-Aware</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>MAC-Aware,</font></strong> and the clients are MAC-Functional.  The
   server can store and transmit labels.  It cannot enforce labels.  The
   server MUST inform clients when an object label changes for a file
   the client has open.

   In this mode, the server may not be aware of the format of any <strong><font color='green'>of</font></strong> its
   object labels.  Indeed, it may service several different security
   models at the same time.  A client MUST process foreign labels as
   discussed in Section 3.3.  As with the Guest Mode, this mode's level
   of trust can be degraded if <strike><font color='red'>non-MAC-functional</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>non-MAC-Functional</font></strong> clients have access to
   the server.

4.3.  Guest Mode

   Only one of the server or client is MAC-Functional enabled.

   In the case of the server only being MAC-Functional, the server
   enforces its <strike><font color='red'>policy,</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>policy</font></strong> and may selectively provide standard NFS services
   to clients based on their authentication credentials and/or
   associated network attributes (e.g., IP address, network interface)
   according to security policy.  The level of trust and access extended
   to a client in this mode is configuration-specific.

   In the case of the client only being MAC-Functional, the client MUST
   operate as a standard NFSv4.2 (see <strike><font color='red'>[I-D.ietf-nfsv4-minorversion2])
   client,</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>[NFSv4_2]) client</font></strong> and SHOULD
   selectively provide processes access to servers based upon the
   security attributes of the local process, and network attributes of
   the server, according to policy.  The client may also override
   default labeling of the remote file system based upon these security <strike><font color='red'>attributes,</font></strike>
   <strong><font color='green'>attributes</font></strong> or other labeling methods such as mount point labeling.

   In other words, <strong><font color='green'>the</font></strong> Guest Mode is standard NFSv4.2 over the wire,
   with the MAC-Functional system mapping the non-MAC-Functional
   system's processes or objects to security labels based on other
   characteristics in order to preserve its MAC guarantees.

5.  Use Cases

   MAC labeling is meant to allow NFSv4.2 to be deployed in <strike><font color='red'>site</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>site-</font></strong>
   configurable security schemes.  The LFS and opaque data scheme allows
   for flexibility to meet these different implementations.  In this
   section, we provide some examples of how NFSv4.2 could be deployed to
   meet existing needs.  This is not an exhaustive listing.

5.1.  Full MAC <strike><font color='red'>labeling support</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>Labeling Support</font></strong> for <strike><font color='red'>remotely mounted filesystems</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>Remotely Mounted Filesystems</font></strong>

   In this case, we assume a local networked environment where the
   servers and clients are under common administrative control.  All
   systems in this network have the same MAC implementation and
   semantically identical MAC security labels for objects <strike><font color='red'>(i.e.</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>(i.e.,</font></strong> labels
   mean the same thing on different systems, even if the policies on
   each system may differ to some extent).  Clients will be able to
   apply fine-grained MAC policy to objects accessed via NFS <strike><font color='red'>mounts,</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>mounts</font></strong> and
   thus improve the overall consistency of MAC policy application within
   this environment.

   An example of this case would be where user home directories are
   remotely mounted, and fine-grained MAC policy is implemented to
   protect, for example, private user data from being read by malicious
   web scripts running in the user's browser.  With Labeled NFS, fine-
   grained MAC labeling of the user's files will allow the MAC policy to
   be implemented and provide the desired protection.

5.2.  MAC <strike><font color='red'>labeling</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>Labeling</font></strong> of <strike><font color='red'>virtual machine images stored</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>Virtual Machine Images Stored</font></strong> on the <strike><font color='red'>network</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>Network</font></strong>

   Virtualization is now a commonly implemented feature of modern
   operating systems, and there is a need to ensure that MAC security
   policy is able to protect virtualized resources.  A common
   implementation scheme involves storing virtualized guest filesystems
   on a networked <strike><font color='red'>server, which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>server; these filesystems</font></strong> are then mounted remotely by
   guests upon instantiation.  In this case, there is a need to ensure
   that the local guest kernel is able to access fine-grained MAC labels
   on the remotely mounted filesystem so that its MAC security policy
   can be applied.

5.3.  Simple <strike><font color='red'>security label storage</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>Security Label Storage</font></strong>

   In this case, a mixed and loosely administered network is assumed,
   where nodes may be running a variety of operating systems with
   different security mechanisms and security policies.  It is desired
   that network file servers be simply capable of storing and retrieving
   MAC security labels for clients <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> use such labels.  The Labeled
   NFS protocol would be implemented here solely to enable transport of
   MAC security labels across the network.  It should be noted that in
   such an environment, overall security cannot be as strongly enforced
   as when the server is also <strike><font color='red'>enforcing,</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>enforcing</font></strong> and that this scheme is aimed at
   allowing MAC-capable clients to function with its MAC security policy
   enabled rather than perhaps disabling it entirely.

5.4.  Diskless Linux

   A number of popular operating system distributions depend on a
   <strike><font color='red'>mandatory access control</font></strike>
   <strong><font color='green'>Mandatory Access Control</font></strong> (MAC) model to implement a kernel-enforced
   security policy.  Typically, such models assign particular roles to
   individual processes, which limit or permit performing certain
   operations on a set of files, directories, sockets, or other objects.
   While the enforcing of the policy is typically a matter for the
   diskless NFS client itself, the filesystem objects in such models
   will typically carry MAC labels that are used to define policy on
   access.  These policies may, for instance, describe privilege
   transitions that cannot be replicated using standard NFS <strike><font color='red'>ACL based</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>ACL-based</font></strong>
   models.

   For <strike><font color='red'>instance</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>instance,</font></strong> on a <strike><font color='red'>SYSV compatible</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>SYSV-compatible</font></strong> system, if the 'init' process
   spawns a process that attempts to start the 'NetworkManager'
   executable, there may be a policy that sets up a role transition if
   the 'init' process and 'NetworkManager' file labels match a
   particular rule.  Without this role transition, the process may find
   itself having insufficient privileges to perform its primary job of
   configuring network interfaces.

   In setups of this type, a lot of the policy targets (such as sockets
   or privileged system calls) are entirely local to the client.  The
   use of RPCSEC_GSSv3 <strike><font color='red'>([rpcsecgssv3])</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>([RPC_SEC])</font></strong> for enforcing compliance at the
   server level is therefore of limited value.  The ability to
   permanently label files and have those labels read back by the client
   is, however, crucial to the ability to enforce that policy.

5.5.  Multi-Level Security

   In <strike><font color='red'>a</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>an</font></strong> MLS <strike><font color='red'>system</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>system,</font></strong> objects are generally assigned a sensitivity level
   and a set of compartments.  The sensitivity levels within the system
   are given an order ranging from lowest to highest classification
   level.  Read access to an object is allowed when the sensitivity
   level of the subject "dominates" the object it wants to access.  This
   means that the sensitivity level of the subject is higher than that
   of the object it wishes to access and that its set of compartments is
   a <strike><font color='red'>super-set</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>superset</font></strong> of the compartments on the object.

   The rest of <strike><font color='red'>the</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>this</font></strong> section will just use sensitivity levels.  In <strike><font color='red'>general</font></strike>
   <strong><font color='green'>general,</font></strong> the example is a client that wishes to list the contents of
   a directory.  The system defines the sensitivity levels as
   Unclassified (U), Secret (S), and Top Secret (TS).  The directory to
   be searched is labeled Top <strike><font color='red'>Secret</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>Secret,</font></strong> which means access to read the
   directory will only be granted if the subject making the request is
   also labeled Top Secret.

5.5.1.  Full Mode - <strike><font color='red'>MAC-functional</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>MAC-Functional</font></strong> Client and Server

   In the first part of this <strike><font color='red'>example</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>example,</font></strong> a process on the client is running
   at the Secret level.  The process issues a readdir() system <strike><font color='red'>call</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>call,</font></strong>
   which enters the kernel.  Before translating the readdir() system
   call into a request to the NFSv4.2 <strike><font color='red'>server</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>server,</font></strong> the host operating system
   will consult the MAC module to see if the operation is allowed.
   Since the process is operating at Secret and the directory to be
   accessed is labeled Top <strike><font color='red'>Secret</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>Secret,</font></strong> the MAC module will deny the request
   and an error code is returned to user space.

   Consider a second case where instead of running at Secret the process
   is running at Top Secret.  In this <strike><font color='red'>case</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>case,</font></strong> the sensitivity of the
   process is equal to or greater than that of the <strike><font color='red'>directory</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>directory,</font></strong> so the MAC
   module will allow the request.  Now the readdir() is translated into
   the necessary NFSv4.2 call to the server.  For the <strike><font color='red'>RPC request</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>remote procedure
   call (RPC) request,</font></strong> the client is using the proper credential to
   assert to the server that the process is running at Top Secret.

   When the server receives the <strike><font color='red'>request</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>request,</font></strong> it extracts the security label
   from the RPC session and retrieves the label on the directory.  The
   server then checks with its MAC module <strong><font color='green'>to see</font></strong> if a Top Secret process
   is allowed to read the contents of the Top Secret directory.  Since
   this is allowed by the <strike><font color='red'>policy</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>policy,</font></strong> then the server will return the
   appropriate information back to the client.

   In this <strike><font color='red'>example</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>example,</font></strong> the policy on <strong><font color='green'>both</font></strong> the client and server <strike><font color='red'>were both</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>is</font></strong> the
   same.  In the event that they were running different <strike><font color='red'>policies</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>policies,</font></strong> a
   translation of the labels might be needed.  In this <strike><font color='red'>case</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>case,</font></strong> it could be
   possible for a check to pass on the client and fail on the server.
   The server may consider additional information when making its policy
   decisions.  For <strike><font color='red'>example</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>example,</font></strong> the server could determine that a certain
   subnet is only cleared for data up to Secret classification.  If that
   constraint was in place for the example <strike><font color='red'>above</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>above,</font></strong> the client would still
   succeed, but the server would <strike><font color='red'>fail</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>fail,</font></strong> since the client is asserting a
   label that it is not able to use (Top Secret on a Secret network).

5.5.2.  MAC-Functional Client

   In these scenarios, the server is either non-MAC-Aware or MAC-Aware.
   The actions of the client will depend <strong><font color='green'>on</font></strong> whether it is configured to
   treat the MAC-Aware server in the same manner as the non-MAC-Aware
   one.  <strike><font color='red'>I.e.,</font></strike>  <strong><font color='green'>That is,</font></strong> does it utilize the approach presented in Section <strike><font color='red'>4.3</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>4.3,</font></strong>
   or does it allow the MAC-Aware server to return labels?

   With a client that is MAC-Functional and using the example in the
   previous section, the result should be the same.  The one difference
   is that all decisions are made on the client.

5.5.2.1.  MAC-Aware Server

   A process on the client labeled Secret wishes to access a directory
   labeled Top Secret on the server.  This is <strike><font color='red'>denied</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>denied,</font></strong> since Secret does
   not dominate Top Secret.  Note that there will be NFSv4.2 operations
   issued that return an object label for the client to process.

   Note that in this scenario, all of the clients must be MAC-
   Functional.  A single client <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> does not do its access control
   checks would violate the model.

5.5.2.2.  Non-MAC-Aware Server

   A process on the client labeled Secret wishes to access a directory
   <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike>
   <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> the client's policies label as Top Secret on the server.  This
   is <strike><font color='red'>denied</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>denied,</font></strong> since Secret does not dominate Top Secret.  Note that
   there will not be NFSv4.2 operations issued.  If the process had <strike><font color='red'>instead</font></strike> a
   Top Secret process <strike><font color='red'>label,</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>label instead of Secret,</font></strong> the client would issue
   NFSv4.2 operations to access the directory on the server.

5.5.3.  MAC-Functional Server

   With a MAC-Functional server and a client <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> is not, the client
   behaves as if it were in a normal NFSv4.2 environment.  Since the
   process on the client does not provide a security <strike><font color='red'>attribute</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>attribute,</font></strong> the
   server must define a mechanism for labeling all requests from a
   client.  Assume that the server is using the same criteria used in
   the first example.  The server sees the request as coming from a
   subnet that is a Secret network.  The server determines that all
   clients on that subnet will have their requests labeled with Secret.
   Since the directory on the server is labeled Top Secret and Secret
   does not dominate Top <strike><font color='red'>Secret</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>Secret,</font></strong> the server would fail the request with
   NFS4ERR_ACCESS.

6.  <strike><font color='red'>IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

7.</font></strike>  Security Considerations

<strike><font color='red'>7.1.</font></strike>

<strong><font color='green'>6.1.</font></strong>  Trust Needed for a Community

   Labeled NFS is a transport mechanism for labels, a storage
   requirement for labels, and a definition of how to interpret labels.
   It defines the responsibilities of the client and the server in the
   various permutations of being MAC-Functional.  It does <strike><font color='red'>not however</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>not, however,</font></strong>
   dictate in any manner whether assumptions can be made about other
   entities in the relationship.  For example, it does not define
   whether a MAC-Functional client can demand that a MAC-Aware server
   only accept requests from other MAC-Functional clients.  That is a
   policy based <strike><font color='red'>in</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>on</font></strong> a MAC <strike><font color='red'>model</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>model,</font></strong> and this document does not impose
   policies on systems.

   As the requirement is a policy, it can be met with the use of a MAC
   model.  Let L be <strike><font color='red'>a</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>an</font></strong> LFS <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> implements the Limited Server mode,
   i.e., a MAC-Aware server connected to MAC-Functional clients.  Then a
   new <strike><font color='red'>LFS L'</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>LFS, L',</font></strong> can be created <strike><font color='red'>which</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>that</font></strong> has the additional policy that the
   MAC-Aware server MUST NOT accept any requests from a non-MAC-
   Functional client.

<strike><font color='red'>7.2.</font></strike>

<strong><font color='green'>6.2.</font></strong>  Guest Modes

   When either the client or server is operating in guest <strike><font color='red'>mode</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>mode,</font></strong> it is
   important to realize that one side is not enforcing MAC protections.
   Alternate methods are being used to handle the lack of MAC <strike><font color='red'>support</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>support,</font></strong>
   and care should be taken to identify and mitigate threats from
   possible tampering outside of these methods.

<strike><font color='red'>7.3.</font></strike>

<strong><font color='green'>6.3.</font></strong>  MAC-Functional Client Configuration

   We defined a MAC model as <strike><font color='red'>a</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>an</font></strong> access control decision made on a system
   <strong><font color='green'>in</font></strong> which normal users do not have the ability to override policies
   (see Section 1).  If the process labels are created solely on the
   client, then if a malicious user has sufficient access on that
   client, the Labeled NFS model is compromised.  Note that this is no
   different from:

   o  current implementations in which the server uses policies to
      effectively determine the object label for requests from the
      client, or

   o  local decisions made on the client by the MAC security system.

   <strike><font color='red'>The</font></strike>

   <strong><font color='green'>Either the</font></strong> server must <strike><font color='red'>either</font></strike> explicitly trust the client (as in <strike><font color='red'>[SENFSV3])</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>[SENFSv3])</font></strong>
   or the MAC model should enforce that users cannot override policies,
   perhaps via <strike><font color='red'>a</font></strike> <strong><font color='green'>an</font></strong> externally managed source.

   Once the labels leave the client, they can be protected by the
   transport mechanism as described in Section 3.2.
