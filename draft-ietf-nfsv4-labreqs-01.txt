1.  Introduction

   Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have been mainstreamed in
   modern operating systems such as Linux (R), FreeBSD (R), and Solaris
   (TM).  MAC systems bind security attributes to subjects (processes)
   and objects within a system.  These attributes are used with other
   information in the system to make access control decisions.

   Access control models such as Unix permissions or Access Control
   Lists are commonly referred to as Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
   models.  These systems base their access decisions on user identity
   and resource ownership.  In contrast MAC models base their access
   control decisions on the label on the subject (usually a process) and
   the object it wishes to access.  These labels may contain user
   identity information but usually contain additional information.  In
   DAC systems users are free to specify the access rules for resources
   that they own.  MAC models base their security decisions on a system
   wide policy established by an administrator or organization which the
   users do not have the ability to override.  DAC systems offer no real
   protection against malicious or flawed software due to each program
   running with the full permissions of the user executing it.
   Inversely MAC models can confine malicious or flawed software and
   usually act at a finer granularity than their DAC counterparts.

   People desire to use NFSv4 with these systems.  A mechanism is
   required to provide security attribute information to NFSv4 clients
   and servers.  This mechanism has the following requirements:

   (1)  Clients must be able to convey to the server the security
        attribute of the subject making the access request.  The server
        may provide a mechanism to enforce MAC policy based on the
        requesting subject's security attribute.

   (2)  Servers must be able to store and retrieve the security
        attribute of exported files as requested by the client.

   (3)  Servers must provide a mechanism for notifying clients of
        attribute changes of files on the server.

   (4)  Clients and Servers must be able to negotiate Label Formats and
        provide a mechanism to translate between them as needed.


2.  Definitions

   Label Format Specifier (LFS):  is an identifier used by the client to
      establish the syntactic format of the security label and the
      semantic meaning of its components.  These specifiers exist in a
      registry associated with documents describing the format and
      semantics of the label.

   Label Format Registry:  is the IANA registry (see [2]) containing all
      registered LFS along with references to the documents that
      describe the syntactic format and semantics of the security label.

   Policy Identifier (PI):  is an optional part of the definition of a
      Label Format Specifier which allows for clients and server to
      identify specific security policies.

   Object:  is a passive resource within the system that we wish to be
      protected.  Objects can be entities such as files, directories,
      pipes, sockets, and many other system resources relevant to the
      protection of the system state.

   Subject:  is an active entity, usually a process, which is requesting
      access to an object.

   MAC-Aware:  is a server which can transmit and store object labels.

   MAC-Functional:  is a client or server which is LNFS enabled.  Such a
      system can interpret labels and apply policies based on the
      security system.

   Multi-Level Security (MLS):  is a traditional model where objects are
      given a sensitivity level (Unclassified, Secret, Top Secret, etc)
      and a category set [5].


3.  Requirements

   The following initial requirements have been gathered from users,
   developers, and from previous development efforts in this area such
   as DTOS [6] and NSA's experimental NFSv3 enhancements [7].

3.1.  Portability & Interoperability

   LNFS must be designed with portability in mind, to facilitate
   implementations on any operating system that supports mandatory
   access controls.

   LNFS must be designed and developed to facilitate interoperability
   between different LNFS implementations.

Internet-Draft                ReqLabledNFS                      May 2012


   LNFS modifications to standard NFSv4.2 [3] implementations must not
   adversely impact any existing interoperability of those
   implementations.

3.2.  Performance & Scalability

   Security mechanisms often impact on system performance.  LNFS should
   be designed and implemented in a way which avoids significant
   performance impact where possible.

   As NFSv4.2 is designed for large-scale distributed networking, LNFS
   should also be capable of scaling in a similar manner to underlying
   implementations where possible.

   LNFS should respond in a robust manner to system and network outages
   associated with typical enterprise and Internet environments.  At the
   very least, LNFS should always operate in a fail-safe manner, so that
   service disruptions do not cause or facilitate security
   vulnerabilities.

3.3.  Security Services

   LNFS should ensure that the following security services are provided
   for all NFSv4.2 messaging.  These services may be provided by lower
   layers even if NFS has to be aware of and leverage them:

   o  Authentication

   o  Integrity

   o  Privacy

   Mechanisms and algorithms used in the provision of security services
   must be configurable, so that appropriate levels of protection may be
   flexibly specified per mandatory security policy.

   Strong mutual authentication will be required between the server and
   the client for Full Mode operation Section 3.5.1.

   MAC security labels and any related security state must always be
   protected by these security services when transferred over the
   network; as must the binding of labels and state to associated
   objects and subjects.

   LNFS should support authentication on a context granularity so that
   different contexts running on a client can use different
   cryptographic keys and facilities.

3.4.  Label Encoding, Label Format Specifiers, and Label Checking
      Authorities

   Encoding of MAC labels and attributes passed over the network must be
   specified in a complete and unambiguous manner while maintaining the
   flexibility of MAC implementations.  To accomplish this the labels
   should consist of an opaque component bound with a Label Format
   Specifier (LFS).  The LFS component provides a mechanism for
   identifying the structure and semantics of the opaque component.
   Meanwhile, the opaque component is the security label which will be
   interpreted by the MAC models.

   MAC models base access decisions on security attributes bound to
   subjects and objects.  With a given MAC model, all systems have
   semantically coherent labeling - a security label must always mean
   exactly the same thing on every system.  While this may not be
   necessary for simple MAC models it is recommended that most label
   formats assigned an LFS incorporate this concept into their label
   format.

   LNFS must provide a means for servers and clients to identify their
   LFS for the purposes of authorization, security service selection,
   and security label interpretation.

   A negotiation scheme should be provided, allowing systems from
   different label formats to agree on how they will interpret or
   translate each others labels.  Multiple concurrent agreements may be
   current between a server and a client.

   All security labels and related security state transferred across the
   network must be tagged with a valid LFS.

   If the LFS supported on a system changes, it should renegotiate
   agreements to reflect these changes.

   If a system receives any security label or security state tagged with
   an LFS it does not recognize or cannot interpret, it must reject that
   label or state.

   NFSv4.2 includes features which may cause a client to cross an LFS
   boundary when accessing what appears to be a single file system.  If
   LFS negotiation is supported by the client and the server, the server
   should negotiate a new, concurrent agreement with the client, acting
   on behalf of the externally located source of the files.

   LNFS should define an initial negotiation scheme with the primary
   aims of simplicity and completeness.  This is to facilitate practical
   deployment of systems without being weighed down by complex and over-

   generalized global schemes.  Future extensibility should also be
   taken into consideration.

3.5.  Modes of Operation

   LNFS must cater for two potentially concurrent operating modes,
   depending on the state of MAC functionality:

3.5.1.  Full Mode

   The server and the client have mutually recognized MAC functionality
   enabled, and full LNFS functionality is extended over the network
   between both client and server.

   An example of an operation in full mode is as follows.  On the
   initial lookup, the client requests access to an object on the
   server.  It sends its process security context over to the server.
   The server checks all relevant policies to determine if that process
   context from that client is allowed to access the resource.  Once
   this has succeeded the object with its associated security
   information is released to the client.  Once the client receives the
   object it determines if its policies allow the process running on the
   client access to the object.

   On subsequent operations where the client already has a handle for
   the file, the order of enforcement is reversed.  Since the client
   already has the security context it may make an access decision
   against its policy first.  This enables the client to avoid sending
   requests to the server that it knows will fail regardless of the
   server's policy.  If the client passes its policy checks then it
   sends the request to the server where the client's process context is
   used to determine if the server will release that resource to the
   client.  If both checks pass, the client is given the resource and
   everything succeeds.

   In the event that the client does not trust the server, it may opt to
   use an alternate labeling mechanism regardless of the server's
   ability to return security information.

3.5.2.  Guest Mode

   Only one of the server or client is MAC-Functional enabled.

   In the case of the server only being MAC-Functional, the server
   locally enforces its policy, and may selectively provide standard NFS
   services to clients based on their authentication credentials and/or
   associated network attributes (e.g., IP address, network interface)
   according to security policy.  The level of trust and access extended



Haynes                  Expires November 3, 2012                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                ReqLabledNFS                      May 2012


   to a client in this mode is configuration-specific.

   In the case of the client only being MAC-Functional, the client must
   operate as a standard NFSv4.2 client, and should selectively provide
   processes access to servers based upon the security attributes of the
   local process, and network attributes of the server, according to
   policy.  The client may also override default labeling of the remote
   file system based upon these security attributes, or other labeling
   methods such as mount point labeling.

   In other words, Guest Mode is standard NFSv4.2 over the wire, with
   the MAC-Functional system mapping the non-MAC-Functional system's
   processes or objects to security labels based on other
   characteristics in order to preserve its MAC guarantees.

3.6.  Labeling

   Implementations must validate security labels supplied over the
   network to ensure that they are within a set of labels permitted from
   a specific peer, and if not, reject them.  Note that a system may
   permit a different set of labels to be accepted from each peer.

3.6.1.  Client Labeling

   At the client, labeling semantics for NFS mounted file systems must
   remain consistent with those for locally mounted file systems.  In
   particular, user-level labeling operations local to the client must
   be enacted locally via existing APIs, to ensure compatibility and
   consistency for applications and libraries.

   Note that this does not imply any specific mechanism for conveying
   labels over the network.

   When an object is newly created by the client, it will calculate the
   label for the object based on its policy.  Once that is done it will
   send the request to the server which has the ability to deny the
   creation of the object with that label based on the server's policy.
   In creating the file the server must ensure that the label is bound
   to the object before the object becomes visible to the rest of the
   system.  This ensures that any access control or further labeling
   decisions are correct for the object.

3.6.2.  Server Labeling

   The server must provide the capability for clients to retrieve
   security labels on all exported file system objects where possible.
   This includes cases where only in-core and/or read-only security
   labels are available at the server for any of its exported file



Haynes                  Expires November 3, 2012                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                ReqLabledNFS                      May 2012


   systems.

   The server must honor the ability for a client to specify the label
   of an object on creation.  If the server is MAC enabled it may choose
   to reject the label specified by the client due to restrictions in
   the server policy.  The server should not attempt to find a suitable
   label for an object in event of different labeling rules on its end.
   The server is allowed to translate the label but should not change
   the semantic meaning of the label.

3.7.  Policy Enforcement

3.7.1.  Full Mode

   The server must enforce its security policy over all exported
   objects, for operations which originate both locally and remotely.

   Requests from authenticated clients must be processed using security
   labels and credentials supplied by the client as if they originated
   locally.

   As with labeling, the system must also take into account any other
   volatile client security state, such as a change in process security
   context via dynamic transition.  Access decisions should also be made
   based upon the current client security label accessing the object,
   rather than the security label which opened it, if different.

   The client must apply its own policy to remotely located objects,
   using security labels for the objects obtained from the server.  It
   must be possible to configure the maximum length of time a client may
   cache state regarding remote labels before re-validating that state
   with the server.

   The server must recall delegation of an object if the object's
   security label changes.

   A mechanism must exist to allow the client to obtain access, and
   labeling decisions from the server for locally cached and delegated
   objects, so that it may apply the server's policy to these objects.
   If the server's policy changes, the client must flush all object
   state back to the server.  The server must ensure that any flushed
   state received is consistent with current policy before committing it
   to stable storage.

   Any local security state associated with cached or delegated objects
   must also be flushed back to the server when any other state of the
   objects is required to be flushed back.

Internet-Draft                ReqLabledNFS                      May 2012


3.7.2.  Guest Mode

   If the server is MAC-Functional and the client is not, the server
   must not accept security labels provided by the client, and only
   enforce its policy to exported objects.  In the event that the client
   is MAC-Functional while the server is not then the client may deny
   access or fall back on other methods for providing security labeling.

3.8.  Namespace Access

   The server should provide a means to authorize selective access to
   the exported file system namespace based upon client credentials and
   according to security policy.

   This is a common requirement of MLS-enabled systems, which often need
   to present selective views of namespaces based upon the clearances of
   the subjects.

3.9.  Upgrading Existing Server

   Note that under the MAC model, all objects must have labels.
   Therefore, if an existing server is upgraded to include LNFS support,
   then it is the responsibility of the security system to define the
   behavior for existing objects.  For example, if the security system
   is that the server just stores and returns labels, then existing
   files should return labels which are set to an empty value.


4.  Use Cases

   MAC labeling is meant to allow NFSv4.2 to be deployed in site
   configurable security schemes.  The LFS and opaque data scheme allows
   for flexibility to meet these different implementations.  In this
   section, we provide some examples of how NFSv4.2 could be deployed to
   meet existing needs.  This is not an exhaustive listing.

4.1.  Full MAC labeling support for remotely mounted filesystems

   In this case, we assume a local networked environment where the
   servers and clients are under common administrative control.  All
   systems in this network have the same MAC implementation and
   semantically identical MAC security labels for objects (i.e. labels
   mean the same thing on different systems, even if the policies on
   each system may differ to some extent).  Clients will be able to
   apply fine-grained MAC policy to objects accessed via NFS mounts, and
   thus improve the overall consistency of MAC policy application within
   this environment.

Internet-Draft                ReqLabledNFS                      May 2012


   An example of this case would be where user home directories are
   remotely mounted, and fine-grained MAC policy is implemented to
   protect, for example, private user data from being read by malicious
   web scripts running in the user's browser.  With Labeled NFS, fine-
   grained MAC labeling of the user's files will allow the MAC policy to
   be implemented and provide the desired protection.

4.2.  MAC labeling of virtual machine images stored on the network

   Virtualization is now a commonly implemented feature of modern
   operating systems, and there is a need to ensure that MAC security
   policy is able to protect virtualized resources.  A common
   implementation scheme involves storing virtualized guest filesystems
   on a networked server, which are then mounted remotely by guests upon
   instantiation.  In this case, there is a need to ensure that the
   local guest kernel is able to access fine-grained MAC labels on the
   remotely mounted filesystem so that its MAC security policy can be
   applied.

4.3.  International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)

   The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) is put forth by
   the United States Department of State, Directorate of Defense and
   Trade Controls.  ITAR places strict requirements on the export and
   thus access of defense articles and defense services.  Organizations
   that manage projects with articles and services deemed as within the
   scope of ITAR must ensure the regulations are met.  The regulations
   require an assurance that ITAR information is accessed on a need-to-
   know basis, thus requiring strict, centrally managed access controls
   on items labeled as ITAR.  Additionally, organizations must be able
   to prove that the controls were adequately maintained and that
   foreign nationals were not permitted access to these defense articles
   or service.  ITAR control applicability may be dynamic; information
   may become subject to ITAR after creation (e.g., when the defense
   implications of technology are recognized).

4.4.  Legal Hold/eDiscovery

   Increased cases of legal holds on electronic sources of information
   (ESI) have resulted in organizations taking a pro-active approach to
   reduce the scope and thus costs associated with these activities.
   ESI Data Maps are increasing in use and require support in operating
   systems to strictly manage access controls in the case of a legal
   hold.  The sizeable quantity of information involved in a legal
   discovery request may preclude making a copy of the information to a
   separate system that manages the legal hold on the copies; this
   results in a need to enforce the legal hold on the original
   information.

   Organizations are taking steps to map out the sources of information
   that are most likely to be placed under a legal hold, these efforts
   result in ESI Data Maps.  ESI Data Maps specify the Electronic Source
   of Information and the requirements for sensitivity and criticality.
   In the case of a legal hold, the ESI data map and labels can be used
   to ensure the legal hold is properly enforced on the predetermined
   set of information.  An ESI data map narrows the scope of a legal
   hold to the predetermined ESI.  The information must then be
   protected at a level of security of which the weight and
   admissibility of that evidence may be proved in a court of law.
   Current systems use application level controls and do not adequately
   meet the requirements.  Labels may be used in advance when an ESI
   data map exercise is conducted with controls being applied at the
   time of a hold or labels may be applied to data sets during an
   eDiscovery exercise to ensure the data protections are adequate
   during the legal hold period.

   Note that this use case requires multi-attribute labels, as both
   information sensitivity (e.g., to disclosure) and information
   criticality (e.g., to continued business operations) need to be
   captured.

4.5.  Simple security label storage

   In this case, a mixed and loosely administered network is assumed,
   where nodes may be running a variety of operating systems with
   different security mechanisms and security policies.  It is desired
   that network file servers be simply capable of storing and retrieving
   MAC security labels for clients which use such labels.  The LNFS
   protocol would be implemented here solely to enable transport of MAC
   security labels across the network.  It should be noted that in such
   an environment, overall security cannot be as strongly enforced as
   when the server is also enforcing, and that this scheme is aimed at
   allowing MAC-capable clients to function with its MAC security policy
   enabled rather than perhaps disabling it entirely.

4.6.  Diskless Linux

   A number of popular operating system distributions depend on a
   mandatory access control (MAC) model to implement a kernel-enforced
   security policy.  Typically, such models assign particular roles to
   individual processes, which limit or permit performing certain
   operations on a set of files, directories, sockets, or other objects.
   While the enforcing of the policy is typically a matter for the
   diskless NFS client itself, the filesystem objects in such models
   will typically carry MAC labels that are used to define policy on
   access.  These policies may, for instance, describe privilege
   transitions that cannot be replicated using standard NFS ACL based

   models.

   For instance on a SYSV compatible system, if the 'init' process
   spawns a process that attempts to start the 'NetworkManager'
   executable, there may be a policy that sets up a role transition if
   the 'init' process and 'NetworkManager' file labels match a
   particular rule.  Without this role transition, the process may find
   itself having insufficient privileges to perform its primary job of
   configuring network interfaces.

   In setups of this type, a lot of the policy targets (such as sockets
   or privileged system calls) are entirely local to the client.  The
   use of RPCSEC_GSSv3 ([4]) for enforcing compliance at the server
   level is therefore of limited value.  The ability to permanently
   label files and have those labels read back by the client is,
   however, crucial to the ability to enforce that policy.

4.7.  Multi-Level Security

   In a MLS system objects are generally assigned a sensitivity level
   and a set of compartments.  The sensitivity levels within the system
   are given an order ranging from lowest to highest classification
   level.  Read access to an object is allowed when the sensitivity
   level of the subject "dominates" the object it wants to access.  This
   means that the sensitivity level of the subject is higher than that
   of the object it wishes to access and that its set of compartments is
   a super-set of the compartments on the object.

   The rest of the section will just use sensitivity levels.  In general
   the example is a client that wishes to list the contents of a
   directory.  The system defines the sensitivity levels as Unclassified
   (U), Secret (S), and Top Secret (TS).  The directory to be searched
   is labeled Top Secret which means access to read the directory will
   only be granted if the subject making the request is also labeled Top
   Secret.

4.7.1.  Full Mode - MAC-functional Client and Server

   In the first part of this example a process on the client is running
   at the Secret level.  The process issues a readdir() system call
   which enters the kernel.  Before translating the readdir() system
   call into a request to the NFSv4.2 server the host operating system
   will consult the MAC module to see if the operation is allowed.
   Since the process is operating at Secret and the directory to be
   accessed is labeled Top Secret the MAC module will deny the request
   and an error code is returned to user space.

   Consider a second case where instead of running at Secret the process



Haynes                  Expires November 3, 2012               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                ReqLabledNFS                      May 2012


   is running at Top Secret.  In this case the sensitivity of the
   process is equal to or greater than that of the directory so the MAC
   module will allow the request.  Now the readdir() is translated into
   the necessary NFSv4.2 call to the server.  For the RPC request the
   client is using the proper credential to assert to the server that
   the process is running at Top Secret.

   When the server receives the request it extracts the security label
   from the RPC session and retrieves the label on the directory.  The
   server then checks with its MAC module if a Top Secret process is
   allowed to read the contents of the Top Secret directory.  Since this
   is allowed by the policy then the server will return the appropriate
   information back to the client.

   In this example the policy on the client and server were both the
   same.  In the event that they were running different policies a
   translation of the labels might be needed.  In this case it could be
   possible for a check to pass on the client and fail on the server.
   The server may consider additional information when making its policy
   decisions.  For example the server could determine that a certain
   subnet is only cleared for data up to Secret classification.  If that
   constraint was in place for the example above the client would still
   succeed, but the server would fail since the client is asserting a
   label that it is not able to use (Top Secret on a Secret network).

4.7.2.  MAC-Functional Client

   In these scenarios, the server is either non-MAC-Aware or MAC-Aware.
   The actions of the client will depend whether it is configured to
   treat the MAC-Aware server in the same manner as the non-MAC-Aware
   one.  I.e., does it utilize the approach presented in Section 3.5.2
   or does it allow the MAC-Aware server to return labels?

   With a client that is MAC-Functional and using the example in the
   previous section, the result should be the same.  The one difference
   is that all decisions are made on the client.

4.7.2.1.  MAC-Aware Server

   A process on the client labeled Secret wishes to access a directory
   labeled Top Secret on the server.  This is denied since Secret does
   not dominate Top Secret.  Note that there will be NFSv4.2 operations
   issued that return an object label for the client to process.

   Note that in this scenario, all of the clients must be MAC-
   Functional.  A single client which does not do its access control
   checks would violate the model.

Internet-Draft                ReqLabledNFS                      May 2012


4.7.2.2.  Non-MAC-Aware Server

   A process on the client labeled Secret wishes to access a directory
   which the client's policies label as Top Secret on the server.  This
   is denied since Secret does not dominate Top Secret.  Note that there
   will not be NFSv4.2 operations issued.  If the process had instead a
   Top Secret process label, the client would issue NFSv4.2 operations
   to access the directory on the server.

4.7.3.  MAC-Functional Server

   With a MAC-Functional server and a client which is not, the client
   behaves as if it were in a normal NFSv4.2 environment.  Since the
   process on the client does not provide a security attribute the
   server must define a mechanism for labeling all requests from a
   client.  Assume that the server is using the same criteria used in
   the first example.  The server sees the request as coming from a
   subnet that is a Secret network.  The server determines that all
   clients on that subnet will have their requests labeled with Secret.
   Since the directory on the server is labeled Top Secret and Secret
   does not dominate Top Secret the server would fail the request with
   NFS4ERR_ACCESS.


5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Guest Modes

   When either the client or server is operating in guest mode it is
   important to realize that one side is not enforcing MAC protections.
   Alternate methods are being used to handle the lack of MAC support
   and care should be taken to identify and mitigate threats from
   possible tampering outside of these methods.

5.2.  MAC-Functional Client Configuration

   We defined a MAC model as a access control decision made on a system
   which normal users do not have the ability to override policies (see
   Section 1).  If the process labels are created solely on the client,
   then if a malicious user has sufficient access on that client, the
   LNFS model is compromised.  Note that this is no different from:

   o  current implementations in which the server uses policies to
      effectively determine the object label for requests from the
      client, or

   o  local decisions made on the client by the MAC security system.

   The server must either explicitly trust the client (as in [7]) or the
   MAC model should enforce that users cannot override policies, perhaps
   via a externally managed source.

   Once the labels leave the client, they can be protected by the
   transport mechanism as described in Section 3.3.


6.  IANA Considerations

   It is requested that IANA creates a registry of Label Formats to
   describe the syntactic format and semantics of the security label
   (see [2]).
