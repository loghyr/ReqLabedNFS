  <t>
    It is requested that IANA creates a registry of Domain of
    Interpretation numbers to be consumed by a Domain of Interpretation
    authority which will provide the mappings. A range of these numbers should be
    reserved for private DOIs that are consumed solely on internal networks
    analogous to the 127 and 198 class A ip ranges for IPv4.
