<section anchor='req' title='Requirements'>

  <t>
    The following initial requirements have been gathered from users,
    developers, and from previous development efforts in this area such as
    DTOS <xref target='DTOS' /> and NSA's experimental NFSv3 enhancements
    <xref target='SENFSV3' />.
  </t>

  <section anchor='req:portinter' title='Portability & Interoperability'>
    <t>
      LNFS must be designed with portability in mind, to
      facilitate implementations on any operating system that supports mandatory
      access controls.
    </t>

    <t>
      LNFS must be designed and developed to facilitate interoperability between
      different LNFS implementations.
    </t>

    <t>
      LNFS modifications to standard NFSv4.2 implementations must not adversely
      impact any existing interoperability of those implementations.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor='req:perfscale' title='Performance & Scalability'>
    <t>
      Security mechanisms often impact on system performance.  LNFS should
      be designed and implemented in a way which avoids significant performance
      impact where possible.
    </t>
    <t>
      As NFSv4.2 is designed for large-scale distributed networking, LNFS
      should also be capable of scaling in a similar manner to underlying
      implementations where possible.
    </t>
    <t>
      LNFS should respond in a robust manner to system and network
      outages associated with typical enterprise and Internet environments.  At the
      very least, LNFS should always operate in a fail-safe manner, so that service
      disruptions do not cause or facilitate security vulnerabilities.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor='req:secserv' title='Security Services'>
    <t>
      LNFS should ensure that the following security services are provided for
      all NFSv4.2 messaging. These services may be provided by lower layers even if NFS
      has to be aware of and leverage them:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Authentication</t>
        <t>Integrity</t>
        <t>Privacy</t>
      </list>
    </t>

    <t>
      Mechanisms and algorithms used in the provision of security services
      must be configurable, so that appropriate levels of protection may be flexibly
      specified per mandatory security policy.
    </t>

    <t>
      Strong mutual authentication will be required between the server and
      the client for Full Mode operation <xref target='req:opmodes:full' />.
    </t>

    <t>
      MAC security labels and any related security state must always be
      protected by these security services when transferred over the network;
      as must the binding of labels and state to associated objects and
      subjects.
    </t>

    <t>
      LNFS should support authentication on a context granularity so
      that different contexts running on a client can use different
      cryptographic keys and facilities.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor='req:encdoi' title='Label Encoding, Label Format Specifiers, and Labeling Authorities'>
    <t>
      Encoding of MAC labels and attributes passed over the network must
      be specified in a complete and unambiguous manner while maintaining the
      flexibility of MAC implementations. To accomplish this the labels
      should consist of an opaque component bound with a Label Format Specifier (LFS).
      The opaque component consists of the label which will be interpreted by the MAC
      model on the other end while the LFS provides a mechanism for identifying the
      structure and semantics of the label's components.
    </t>

    <t>
      MAC models base access decisions on security attributes bound to
      subjects and objects. With a given MAC model, all systems have
      semantically coherent labeling - a security label must always
      mean exactly the same thing on every system. While this may not be
      necessary for simple MAC models it is recommended that most label formats
      assigned an LFS incorporate this concept into their label format.
    </t>

    <t>
      LNFS must provide a means for servers and clients to identify their
      LFS for the purposes of authorization, security service selection, and
      security label interpretation.
    </t>

    <t>
      A negotiation scheme should be provided, allowing systems from
      different label formats to agree on how they will interpret or
      translate each others labels.  Multiple concurrent agreements may be
      current between a server and a client.
    </t>

    <t>
      All security labels and related security state transferred across the
      network must be tagged with a valid LFS.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the LFS of a system changes, it should renegotiate agreements to
      reflect these changes.
    </t>

    <t>
      If a system receives any security label or security state tagged with an
      LFS it does not recognize or cannot interpret, it must reject that label
      or state.
    </t>

    <t>
      NFSv4.2 includes features which may cause a client to cross an LFS 
      boundary when accessing what appears to be a single file system.  If LFS
      negotiation is supported by the client and the server, the server should
      negotiate a new, concurrent agreement with the client, acting on behalf of
      the externally located source of the files.
    </t>

    <t>
      LNFS should define an initial negotiation scheme
      with the primary aims of simplicity and completeness.  This is to
      facilitate practical deployment of systems without being
      weighed down by complex and over-generalized global schemes.  Future
      extensibility should also be taken into consideration.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor='req:opmodes' title='Modes of Operation'>
    <t>
    LNFS must cater for two potentially concurrent operating modes,
    depending on the state of MAC functionality:
    </t>

    <section anchor='req:opmodes:full' title='Full Mode'>
      <t>
        Both the server and the client have MAC functionality enabled, and
        full LNFS functionality is extended over the network between
        both client and server.
      </t>

      <t>
        An example of an operation in full mode is as follows. On the initial lookup,
        the client requests access to an object on the server. It sends its process
        security context over to the server. The server checks all relevant local
        policies to determine if that process context from that client is allowed to
        access the resource. Once this has succeeded the object with its associated
        security information is released to the client. Once the client receives the
        object it determines if its local policy allows the process running on the
        client access to the object.
      </t>

      <t>
        On subsequent operations where the client already has a handle for the file,
        the order of enforcement is reversed. Since the client already has the security
        context it may make an access decision against its local policy first. This
        enables the client to avoid sending requests to the server that it knows will
        fail regardless of the server's policy. If the client passes the local policy
        check then it sends the request to the server where the client's process
        context is used to determine if the server will release that resource to the
        client. If both checks pass, the client is given the resource and everything
        succeeds.
      </t>

      <t>
        In the event that the client does not trust the server, it may opt to use an
        alternate labeling mechanism regardless of the server's ability to return
        security information.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor='req:opmodes:guest' title='Guest Mode'>
      <t>
        Only one of the server or client has MAC functionality enabled.
      </t>

      <t>
        In the case of the server only having MAC functionality enabled, the server
        locally enforces its policy, and may selectively provide standard NFS
        services to clients based on their authentication credentials and/or
        associated network attributes (e.g. IP address, network interface)
        according to security policy.  The level of trust and access extended
        to a client in this mode is configuration-specific.
      </t>

      <t>
        In the case of the client only having MAC functionality enabled, the
        client must operate as a standard NFSv4.2 client, and should selectively
        provide processes access to servers based upon the security
        attributes of the local process, and network attributes of the server,
        according to policy.  The client may also override default labeling of
        the remote file system based upon these security attributes, or other labeling
        methods such as mount point labeling.
      </t>

      <t>
        In other words, Guest Mode is standard NFSv4.2 over the wire, with the MAC-aware
        system mapping the MAC-unaware system's processes or objects to security
        labels based on other characteristics in order to preserve its local MAC
        guarantees.
      </t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section anchor='req:labeling' title='Labeling'>
    <t>
      Implementations must validate security labels supplied over the network to
      ensure that they are within a set of labels permitted from a specific peer,
      and if not, reject them.  Note that a system may permit a different set of
      labels to be accepted from each peer.
    </t>

    <section anchor='req:labeling:client' title='Client Labeling'>
      <t>
        At the client, labeling semantics for NFS mounted file systems must remain
        consistent with those for locally mounted file systems.  In particular,
        user-level labeling operations local to the client must be enacted locally via
        existing APIs, to ensure compatibility and consistency for applications and
        libraries.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note that this does not imply any specific mechanism for conveying labels over
        the network.
      </t>
      <t>
        When an object is newly created by the client, it will calculate the label for
        the object based on its local policy. Once that is done it will send the
        request to the server which has the ability to deny the creation of the object
        with that label based on the server's policy. In creating the file the server
        must ensure that the label is bound to the object before the object becomes
        visible to the rest of the system.  This ensures that any access control or
        further labeling decisions are correct for the object.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor='req:labeling:server' title='Server Labeling'>
      <t>
        The server must provide the capability for clients to retrieve security labels
        on all exported file system objects where possible.  This includes cases where
        only in-core and/or read-only security labels are available at the server for
        any of its exported file systems.
      </t>

      <t>
        The server must honor the ability for a client to specify the label of an
        object on creation.  If the server is MAC enabled it may choose to reject the
        label specified by the client due to restrictions in the server policy.
        The server should not attempt to find a suitable label for an object in event
        of different labeling rules on its end.  The server is allowed to translate
        the label but should not change the semantic meaning of the label.
      </t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section anchor='req:enforce' title='Policy Enforcement'>
    <section anchor='req:enforce:full' title='Full Mode'>
      <t>
        The server must enforce its local security policy over all exported
        objects, for operations which originate both locally and remotely.
      </t>
      <t>
        Requests from authenticated clients must be processed using security
        labels and credentials supplied by the client as if they originated
        locally.
      </t>
      <t>
        As with labeling, the system must also take into account any other
        volatile client security state, such as a change in process security
        context via dynamic transition.  Access decisions should also be made
        based upon the current client security label accessing the object,
        rather than the security label which opened it, if different.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client must apply its own policy to remotely located objects, using
        security labels for the objects obtained from the server.  It must be
        possible to configure the maximum length of time a client may cache
        state regarding remote labels before re-validating that state with the
        server.
      </t>
      <t>
        The server must recall delegation of an object if the object's security
        label changes.
      </t>
      <t>
        A mechanism must exist to allow the client to obtain access, and labeling
        decisions from the server for locally cached and delegated objects, so
        that it may apply the server's policy to these objects.  If the server's
        policy changes, the client must flush all object state back to the
        server.  The server must ensure that any flushed state received is
        consistent with current policy before committing it to stable storage.
      </t>
      <t>
        Any local security state associated with cached or delegated objects
        must also be flushed back to the server when any other state of the
        objects is required to be flushed back.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor='req:enforce:guest' title='Guest Mode'>
      <t>
        If the server is MAC aware and the client is not, the server must not
        accept security labels provided by the client, and only enforce its
        local policy to exported objects. In the event that
        the client is MAC aware while the server is not then the client may
        deny access or fall back on other methods for providing security labeling.
      </t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section anchor='req:namespace' title='Namespace Access'>
    <t>
      The server should provide a means to authorize selective access to the
      exported file system namespace based upon client credentials and
      according to security policy.
    </t>

    <t>
      This is a common requirement of MLS-enabled systems, which often need
      to present selective views of namespaces based upon the clearances of
      the subjects.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor='req:upgrade' title='Upgrading Existing Server'>
    <t>
      Note that under the MAC model, all objects must have labels.
      Therefore, if an existing server is upgraded to include LNFS support,
      then it is the responsibility of the security system to
      define the behavior for existing objects. For example, if
      the security system is LFS 0, which means the server just
      stores and returns labels, then existing files should
      return labels which are set to an empty value.
